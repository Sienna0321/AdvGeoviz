Love on the Weekend
It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been workin', and I've been waitin'
To pick you up and take you from this place
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm comin' up, and I'm lovin' every minute of it
You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flyin' fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand
Oh, love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in the bottle we were drinkin'
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm lovin' every minute of it
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh
I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty, and my friends are gettin' worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up, but I'm lovin' every minute of it
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm lookin' for a little love
I'm lookin' for a little love, oh, yeah
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
