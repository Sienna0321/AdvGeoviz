## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(textdata)
library(tidyverse)
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

```{r}
get_sentiments("nrc")
```

```{r}
##lines <- readLines("Rosie.txt")
##lines <- readLines("Rosie.txt", warn = FALSE)
```


```{r}
# Set the folder path
folder_path <- "D:/桌面/648/Lab4/Lab4prj/Lab4prj"

# Get a list of all txt files in the folder
file_list <- list.files(folder_path, pattern = "\\.txt$", full.names = TRUE)

# Create an empty list to store the lines from each file
lines_list <- list()

# Use a loop to read each txt file and store each line as a separate observation
for (file_path in file_list) {
  # Read all lines from the txt file
  lines <- readLines(file_path)
  
  # Append the lines to the list
  lines_list <- c(lines_list, lines)
}

# Create a data frame with a single column for each line
data <- data.frame(lines = unlist(lines_list))

# Print or further process the resulting data frame
print(data)
```
